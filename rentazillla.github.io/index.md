## About Me

I recently received my PhD in Pharmacology from the University of Washington. I am looking for a position as a research scientist, a bioinformatician, or a data scientist. My goal is to switch from academic research to a career in biotechnology, software, or the pharmaceutical industry in order to pursue a career in drug discovery or drug development.

## Employment

`2019-2024`
__University of Washington__ Research scientist (PhD awarded July 2024).
> I studied the role of microglia in opioid withdrawal under the mentorship of [Dr. John Neumaier](https://depts.washington.edu/mnsl/). As part of this role I managed teams of research technicians and undergraduates to study mouse behavior, perform biochemistry and molecular biology assays, collect and analyze data from experiments, and write papers towards completion of my PhD in the department of Pharmacology.

## Technical skills

* Python
* R
* Java
* 96-well drug-ligand binding assays
* Molecular biology
* Confocal microscopy (Leica SP8 and Nikon A1R)
* Immunohistochemistry
* Use of machine learning to analyze animal behavior
* Unix and Windows based programming

## Education

`2018-2024`
__University of Washington__ Pharmacology, PhD. _The Impact of Repeated Opioid Withdrawal on Mouse Behavior and Microglia_

`2010-2014`
__University of Colorado Denver__ B.S. Chemistry (_Cum laude_), B.S. Philosophy

## Areas of expertise

* Behavioral Neuroscience
* RNA sequencing
* Proteomics
* Machine learning
* Data visualisation
